# SunrisePreviousVersionsSource
Sunrise has been updated multiple upon multiple times. Which is why for funsies, I thought about releasing the source project files for those older versions that are no longer supported! So you can look at how we used to do it, how we probably still do it now, and to look through WRStudios' stuff! Enjoy this behind the scenes look!

DO NOT REPOST OR CLAIM THESE AS YOURS. PLEASE. WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH DRAMA. AGAIN...
